# Employee-churn-prediction-

In this project, my goal was to develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict employee attrition.
To achieve this, I followed a structured approach and performed the following tasks:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Before building the model, I cleaned the dataset and handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. This step was critical to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis: I performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's distribution, correlations, and trends. This step helped me identify the most important features that could impact employee attrition.

3.Feature Selection and Engineering: Based on the exploratory data analysis, I selected the most critical features and engineered new features to improve the model's performance.

4.Model Building and Evaluation: I utilized various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest classifier, and deep learning techniques, to develop the predictive model. I then evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
